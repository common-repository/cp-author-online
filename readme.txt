This plugin will show you if the ad author is online or not. There is also an animated popup when you hover over image. No JavaScript, all CSS.

== Description ==

This plugin will add an icon to the <a href="https://www.appthemes.com/themes/classipress/?aid=26553" target="_blank">Classipress</a> ad loop page where meta data is. When you hover over the icon with a mouse it will show you a nice CSS animated popup telling you is the user is online or when he/she was last seen online. 

This plugin doesn't use JavaScript for animations, it's all CSS.
